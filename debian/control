Description: Dock any program into the system tray
 AllTray "docks" software into the system tray, making it possible to
 un-clutter things like the task bar.  You can run software such as
 Evolution, Thunderbird, or plain-old xterm and give it an icon in
 the system tray.  When you click on the icon, the application will
 be hidden or shown.
