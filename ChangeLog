	* src/TrayIcon.vala: Removed.

	* src/AllTray.vala: Made the static WnckScreen public so as to
	enable its usage elsewhere in the program.

	* src/Application.vala: Moved tray icon management into the
	Application instance, removed polling for the Wnck.Application in
	favor of watching for its signal instead.  Still deficient in that
	it looks for a PID match, so it still doesn't work for
	applications like OOo and Mono-based software started from a
	wrapper script.  Also, make better use of signals.

	* src/Makefile.am: Removed TrayIcon.vala

	* src/Process.vala: Removed status icon and pid property.

	* Released: AllTray 0.7.1dev.

2009-01-12  Michael B. Trausch  <mike@trausch.us>

	* Created a new ChangeLog to go with the complete and utter
	re-working of the source tree.  Real ChangeLog entries will begin
	after we move away from refactoring and into implementing new and
	interesting things.
