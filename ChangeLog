	* Removed autopackage support from the source tree, since it
	really belongs in a dedicated packaging repository of one form or
	another like would be the case for Debian or Red Hat (or another
	system) packaging.  Source changes required for such packaging
	ought to be managed by the packager.

	* Updated copyright date on ChangeLog.
