AllTray
=======

This is a (testing) repository at github.  I am in the process of
determining whether or not I want to start using git, instead of bzr
which is what I currently use for development.

One thing I am noticing that is missing here is some sort of
crowdsourcing translations framework such as what exists at Launchpad;
though I could be missing something.  Am I right here?

Help on AllTray is always welcome, of course!
