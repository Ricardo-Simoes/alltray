.SH NAME
\#
alltray \(en Dock any program into the system tray
\#
.SH SYNOPSIS
\#
.B alltray
[OPTION...] [\-\-]
.I [program] [args]
\#
.SH DESCRIPTION
\#
Start
.I program
with optional arguments provided in
.I args
and dock it to the system tray.  If
.I args
contains options which start with dashes (\- or \-\-) then the special
\(lqend of options\(rq argument (\-\-) must be given before
.I program
on the command line.  See \fBEXAMPLES\fR below for examples on invoking
AllTray.

AllTray only works on \*(UX and \*(UX-like operating systems with the X11
Window System and compliant window management and system tray management
software running.

AllTray has two modes: regular and \(lqattach\(rq mode.  By default,
AllTray will run in regular mode; to attach to an application, specify
the \-\-attach argument, and AllTray will let you select which
application to attach to.  Additionally, if you want to attach to a
specific already running process, you can specify both \-\-attach and
\-\-process arguments (or simply \-\-process, which implies
\-\-attach); see \fBOPTIONS\fR for more information.
\#
.SH OPTIONS
\#
.IP "\-?, \-\-help"
Show the help (usage) screen.
.IP "\-a, \-\-attach"
Attaches to an already-running application.  If \-\-process is not
specified, AllTray will prompt the user to click on a window for the
application the user would like to dock.
.IP "\-L, \-\-list\-debug\-opts"
Lists the debug \(lqflags\(rq that AllTray supports.  The items in this list
are allowed values in an environment variable named \fBALLTRAY_DEBUG\fR;
see the \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\fR section for more information.
.IP "\-D, \-\-debug"
Enable the debug message printing mechanism of AllTray.  Note that this
requires also setting the environment variable \fBALLTRAY_DEBUG\fR, to
get any debug output; see the \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\fR section below.
.IP "\-p, \-\-process=PID"
Specifies the process ID of the application to attach to; implies
\-\-attach.
.IP "\-v, \-\-version"
Show the program version, copyright, and license.
.IP "\-V, \-\-extended-version"
Show the program version, copyright, license, and build information.
\#
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
\#
.IP "ALLTRAY_OPTIONS"
AllTray reads this environment variable for any default options.  Any of
the options above in \fBOPTIONS\fR can be specified in this environment
variable.  This environment variable is looked at \fIbefore\fR the
command line, so the command line will override it should there be any
conflict.
.IP "ALLTRAY_DEBUG"
When the \-d or \-\-debug options are specified on the command line,
AllTray looks at this environment variable to see which types of debug
messages you are interested in seeing.  For example, setting this
variable to \(lqCMDLINE X11\(rq and enabling debugging will tell AllTray to
display messages pertaining to command-line parsing and communication
with the X Window System.

For a list of valid tokens, run \(lqalltray -L\(rq which will output the
list of supported debugging messages.  Also, you can specify \fBALL\fR
to enable every type of debugging message that AllTray supports.
.IP "DISPLAY"
AllTray reads this environment variable to determine how to find and
connect to your instance of the X Window System.  Using the \-\-display
command line option can override it, or provide it if unset.

.SH EXAMPLES
\#
Here are some examples of invoking AllTray in various situations:
.IP "Simple example"
alltray evolution
\#
.IP "Simple debugging example"
ALLTRAY_DEBUG="ALL" alltray \-D evolution
\#
.IP "Client command line arguments example"
alltray \-\- xterm \-geometry 132x40
\#
.IP "Autostart example"
alltray \-\-wait\-for\-wm \-\-wait\-for\-systray evolution
\#
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\#
AllTray doesn't (yet) emit very helpful diagnostic information on
failure.  This will be remedied prior to the 0.8.0 release.
\#
.SH REQUIREMENTS
\#
AllTray requires a window manager which implements the EWMH
specification (and thus by definition the ICCCM specification).  It also
requires another process which fills the role of the system tray, as
specified in the System Tray Specification.
\#
.SH BUGS
\#
Session management support needs to be implemented.  If you rely on
session management support for your application software, you may
encounter surprising results when combining that software with AllTray
at present.

Some programs at present cannot be started under AllTray, but they
should be ablle to be attached to after they are running.  Any program
that creates windows with a PID other than what g_spawn_async()
receives as a return value (including OpenOffice.org, Mono programs,
and virtually programs started from a shell script which in turn
handles the real program invocation) is affected by this bug.  A
method is being worked on to reliably work around this problem.
Should you find software like this, please do not hesitate to report
it as a bug in AllTray.

There are likely undiscovered bugs.  If you should find one, please
report it at https://launchpad.net/alltray/+filebug.
