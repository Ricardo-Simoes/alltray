 * running on an operating system which does not support LD_PRELOAD (at
 * least HP-UX, possibly others).
 *
 * It would be nice if we could find a way to do this that could be done
 * (portably) on all systems without the use of LD_PRELOAD and with the
 * ability to control the application, even if setuid/setgid.  Actually,
 * there may be.
 *
 * What if AllTray eventually provided a proxy (at the X protocol level)
 * between a child application and the X11 server, kind of like SSH
 * does?  That is an interesting idea, though it may dramatically
 * increase the resource usage of AllTray.  It wouldn't make a bad
 * experimental branch of AllTray, though, if someone wanted to do that.
