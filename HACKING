How to Help!
============

  So, you'd like to help work on AllTray?  There is a feature that you
  really would like, or a bug that is in your way, and you'd like to
  go ahead and take a shot at fixing it?  No problem!  Contributions
  are welcome, so long as you're willing to license them under the
  terms of the GNU GPL 3.0 as published by the Free Software
  Foundation.

  AllTray[1] uses the git[2] revision control system, and the
  “blessed” repository is hosted on github[3].

  Also, AllTray uses Vala[4] for (most) of its code.  There is some
  small parts that are written in C and not generated by the Vala
  compiler.  If you intend on doing any development, you’ll need the
  Vala compiler.  Currently, AllTray uses the Vala 0.10.x series;
  series both older and newer than Vala 0.10.x are untested and
  unsupported at this time.  If you are on an Ubuntu 11.04 system,
  Vala 0.10.x is available from the default package manager sources,
  simply install the valac-0.10 package.

 Contributing to AllTray
 -----------------------

  If you are interested in working on AllTray, use GitHub to "fork"
  the source code.  Then you can "git clone" your forked version, and
  when you're finished with your contribution, you can submit a pull
  request on GitHub.

  If you need help with this process, you can email me
  <mike@trausch.us>, or join the #git or #github channels on the
  FreeNode IRC network.  You can also join #alltray, but I am not
  always there (I do try to be there regularly, however).

  Bugs are (at the moment) still on Launchpad; that will likely change
  as the transition to GitHub becomes more complete.

 Code Formatting
 ---------------

  Code formatting is pretty easy---follow the implicit guidelines that
  you get from reading the existing code, so that I do not need to
  modify it in order to pull/merge it.  If in doubt, though, go ahead
  and do whatever feels right---if there is a problem, it'll be
  addressed when the pull request is reviewed.

 Translations
 ------------

  AllTray currently is written in American English.  Some parts of the
  program may not (yet) be flexible enough for translation or
  localization in any way at all; if this is the case, it is
  considered to be a bug.  I am hoping by the time 0.8.0 is released
  that AllTray will at least be fully translatable, so that people can
  use Launchpad’s Translations to submit translations for the code.

  I may also require help to manage the translations, and some
  pointers to education on working with the requisite tools to make it
  happen.  If you think you want that job, let me know.

  Currently, I am looking for something other than Launchpad
  Translations/Rosetta to do the translations.  But I don't want to
  lose any translators in the process---everyone has been very
  helpful!  Please send me ideas.

 Contact Info
 ------------

  There is an IRC channel: #alltray on FreeNode.  I can be found there
  whenever I am online, and many times when I am not.  Currently,
  there is no traffic in that channel.  People are welcome to change
  this.  :)  I try to be in the IRC channel as much as possible, but I
  do sometimes forget.

  You can contact me via XMPP/Google Talk at <mike@trausch.us>, as
  well.  Or by email, at the same address.

 Other Information
 -----------------

  As we get closer to a release of 0.8.0, there will be more
  information around.  If there is anything missing, please ask!
