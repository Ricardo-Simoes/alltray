How to Help!
============

  So, you'd like to help work on AllTray?  There is a feature that you
  really would like, or a bug that is in your way, and you'd like to
  go ahead and take a shot at fixing it?  No problem!  Contributions
  are welcome, so long as you're willing to license them under the
  terms of the GNU GPL 3.0 as published by the Free Software
  Foundation.

  AllTray[1] uses the Bazaar[2] revision control system.  This means
  that you can branch AllTray’s trunk, work on the sources, and push
  to a personal branch of yours on Launchpad.  You can then request
  that the branch be merged with the trunk.  Details on this process,
  if needed, will be added to this file in the future.

  Also, AllTray uses Vala[3] for (most) of its code.  There is some
  small parts that are written in C and not generated by the Vala
  compiler.  If you intend on doing any development, you’ll need the
  Vala compiler.  Currently, AllTray uses Vala 0.6.0---Vala 0.7.0 is
  incompatible with AllTray at this time, though that will be fixed
  very soon.

 Patching AllTray
 ----------------

  To get started, you’ll need a bleeding-edge copy of the source code.
  That is, you will want the development “trunk“.  You can get this by
  typing the following command (requires the Bazaar DVCS system to be
  installed on your system):

    $ bzr branch lp:alltray

  Then, it’s time to write your changes; make modifications, add
  files, delete files, whatever.  Commit as (in)frequently as you want
  to your local branch---after all, it's your branch!  Just take care
  that the final result of your branch is pretty well-conformant to
  the way things are already done; make sure that your code is
  formatted similarly and so forth.

  If you would like to work on bug-squashing, assessment, or triage,
  feel free to start looking through them at the bug tracker on
  Launchpad.[4] Anything that is both not closed and unassigned is
  available for work.  If you find a bug, of course, _please_ report
  it, even if it is only to say “I found this bug,” or “I found and
  fixed this bug, and here is the associated branch containing the
  fix.”  I would very much like to release a 0.8.0 that works with
  current, standards-compliant desktops with *zero* bugs.

 Code Formatting
 ---------------

  Code formatting is pretty easy---follow the implicit guidelines that
  you get from reading the currently-existing code, so that I do not
  need to modify it in order to merge it into the trunk.  If there are
  any questions about formatting, feel free to ask them at Launchpad
  Answers[5].

 Translations
 ------------

  AllTray currently is written in American English.  Some parts of the
  program may not (yet) be flexible enough for translation or
  localization in any way at all; if this is the case, it is
  considered to be a bug.  I am hoping by the time 0.8.0 is released
  that AllTray will at least be fully translatable, so that people can
  use Launchpad’s Translations to submit translations for the code.

  I may also require help to manage the translations, and some
  pointers to education on working with the requisite tools to make it
  happen.  If you think you want that job, let me know.

 Contact Info
 ------------

  There is not (yet) a mailing list for either users of AllTray or for
  AllTray’s development.  If anyone thinks that such things would be
  useful, please ask a question in Launchpad’s Answers to submit a
  request that they be setup, and I can do that in short order.  I
  have not yet done it because I do not know if there is going to be
  any demand for it.

  There is an IRC channel: #alltray on FreeNode.  I can be found there
  whenever I am online, and many times when I am not.  Currently,
  there is no traffic in that channel.  People are welcome to change
  this.  :)

 Other Information
 -----------------

  As we get closer to a release of 0.8.0, there will be more
  information around.  If there is anything missing, please ask!
