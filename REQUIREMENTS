Requirements and Depenedencies
==============================

  * Vala > 0.7.3 (from git master on May 31, 2009, git commit
    7f2fe1b2, at the earliest) to build from the bzr branch which does
    not have the .c files already generated.

    Optionally, you can use Vala 0.7.3, with the patch provided in
    Vala's git commit 7f2fe1b2.  You can not use Vala 0.7.2 or earlier
    to build this version of AllTray.

  * Currently in order to operate correctly, AllTray pretty much
    requires that it not be used on KDE, and that it not be used to
    dock KDE application software (and possibly Qt software).  This is
    LP bug 357469.

  * Required libraries:
    - gtk 2.12 or better, glib and gobject
    - libwnck

  * An EWMH and ICCCM compliant desktop environment and software.  If
    AllTray is deficient in implementing these standards in any way,
    that is a bug in AllTray.  If AllTray is used with software that
    is non-compliant, the results are undefined.

  * Target applications _absolutely_ must have _NET_WM_PID set on
    their windows or there is absolutely no hope that AllTray will
    work with them.
