Requirements and Depenedencies
==============================

  * Vala 0.7.4

  * Required libraries:
    - gtk 2.12 or better, glib and gobject
    - libwnck
    - libgtop

  * An EWMH and ICCCM compliant desktop environment and software.  If
    AllTray is deficient in implementing these standards in any way,
    that is a bug in AllTray.  If AllTray is used with software that
    is non-compliant, the results are undefined.

  * Target applications _absolutely_ must have _NET_WM_PID set on
    their windows or there is absolutely no hope that AllTray will
    work with them.
