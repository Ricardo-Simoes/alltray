Requirements and Depenedencies
==============================

For Release Builds
------------------

Release builds are tarball releases, which contain a ./configure script.

  * Required libraries:
    - gtk 2.12 or better, glib and gobject and headers
    - libwnck and headers
    - libgtop and headers
    - libXext and headers
    - libXpm and headers

For Development
---------------

For development, you need all of the above things, plus the following:

  * GNU Bazaar 2.0 or later.

  * The GNU build system utilities (autoconf and automake).  GNU
    autoconf must be at least 2.62 and GNU automake must be at least
    1.11.

  * GNU gettext, if you intend on making any modifications to the
    language files.

  * The Vala compiler, 0.10.x series.  Newer releases won't work
    unless you're updating AllTray's source code to build with newer
    versions of Vala.  NOTE: For a release build, you only need Vala
    if you modify a *.vala file, but for builds from the DVCS system,
    the Vala files are _not_ precompiled.

Runtime requirements
--------------------

  * An EWMH and ICCCM compliant desktop environment and software.  If
    AllTray is deficient in implementing these standards in any way,
    that is a bug in AllTray.  If AllTray is used with software that
    is non-compliant, the results are undefined.

  * Target applications _absolutely_ must have _NET_WM_PID set on
    their windows or there is absolutely no hope that AllTray will
    work with them.
