Requirements and Depenedencies
==============================

  * Vala > 0.7.3 (from git master on June 25, 2009, git commit
    359e4816, at the earliest) to build from the bzr branch which does
    not have the .c files already generated.

    Optionally, you can use Vala 0.7.3, with the patch provided in
    Vala's git commit 359e4816.

  * Required libraries:
    - gtk 2.12 or better, glib and gobject
    - libwnck
    - libgtop

  * An EWMH and ICCCM compliant desktop environment and software.  If
    AllTray is deficient in implementing these standards in any way,
    that is a bug in AllTray.  If AllTray is used with software that
    is non-compliant, the results are undefined.

  * Target applications _absolutely_ must have _NET_WM_PID set on
    their windows or there is absolutely no hope that AllTray will
    work with them.
