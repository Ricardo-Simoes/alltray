Requirements and Depenedencies
==============================

For Release Builds
------------------

Release builds are tarball releases, which contain a ./configure script.

  * Required libraries:
    - gtk 2.12 or better, glib and gobject
    - libwnck
    - libgtop

For Development Builds
----------------------

Development builds are branches from bzr, which do not have a
./configure script and have more requirements to build.

  * Vala 0.7.4

  * Autotools stack.  The author uses GNU autoconf 2.62 and automake
    1.11; you may be able to use other versions, but as always, YMMV.
    If you have trouble building AllTray correctly, please be sure to
    be using at least these versions.

Runtime requirements
--------------------

  * An EWMH and ICCCM compliant desktop environment and software.  If
    AllTray is deficient in implementing these standards in any way,
    that is a bug in AllTray.  If AllTray is used with software that
    is non-compliant, the results are undefined.

  * Target applications _absolutely_ must have _NET_WM_PID set on
    their windows or there is absolutely no hope that AllTray will
    work with them.
