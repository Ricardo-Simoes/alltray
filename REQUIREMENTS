Requirements and Depenedencies
==============================

  * Vala > 0.7.3 to build from the bzr branch which does not have the
    *.c files already generated.  If you run 0.7.3, you need patches
    which aren't in the Vala tree yet, contact me (mike@trausch.us).

    Note that if you have Vala 0.7.3, you can apply the patches in
    utils/vala-patches to Vala and you'll be able to build AllTray.
    Hopefully, that will change soon, and no patches to Vala will be
    needed.

  * Currently in order to operate correctly, AllTray pretty much
    requires that it not be used on KDE, and that it not be used to
    dock KDE application software (and possibly Qt software).  This is
    LP bug 357469.

  * Required libraries:
    - gtk 2.12 or better, glib and gobject
    - libwnck

  * An EWMH and ICCCM compliant desktop environment and software.  If
    AllTray is deficient in implementing these standards in any way,
    that is a bug in AllTray.  If AllTray is used with software that
    is non-compliant, the results are undefined.

  * Target applications _absolutely_ must have _NET_WM_PID set on
    their windows or there is absolutely no hope that AllTray will
    work with them.
