Requirements and Depenedencies
==============================

  * Vala > 0.7.0 [from git as of April 8, 2009] to build from the bzr
    branch which does not have the *.c files already generated.

  * Currently in order to operate correctly, AllTray pretty much
    requires that it not be used on KDE, and that it not be used to
    dock KDE application software (and possibly Qt software).  This is
    LP bug 357469.

  * Required libraries:
    - gtk 2.12 or better, glib and gobject
    - libwnck

  * An EWMH and ICCCM compliant desktop environment and software.  If
    AllTray is deficient in implementing these standards in any way,
    that is a bug in AllTray.  If AllTray is used with software that
    is non-compliant, the results are undefined.

  * Target applications _absolutely_ must have _NET_WM_PID set on
    their windows or there is absolutely no hope that AllTray will
    work with them.
