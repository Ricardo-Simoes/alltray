AllTray: Copyright 2004, 2005, Jochen Baier, email@jochen-baier.de

  With AllTray you can dock any application with no native tray icon
  (like Evolution, Thunderbird, Terminals) into the system tray.
  A high-light feature is that a click on the "close" button
  will minimize back to system tray. It works well with Gnome,
  KDE, XFCE 4, Fluxbox and WindowMaker.


**Install:

  (./autogen.sh)
  ./configure
  make

  and as root:

  make install


**Run:

  just start alltray with:

    alltray program_name
      
  This will dock the program into the system tray. A single click
  with the left mouse button on the icon will show the program.
  A click with the right mouse button will show a popdown menu.
  
  A click on the "close" button in the window title will not exit the
  application. The application will be minimized.
  
  To quit the application use the popdown menu or the "FILE->QUIT" menu
  from the application.
  
  If you use the "borderless" option, you can move the window with
  "Alt-left_mouse_button".
  
  Note: Under KDE the "large_icon" option has no effect.


**All options:

  alltray -h:
  
  usage: alltray [options] ["] <program_name> [program parameter] ["]
  
  where options include:
  
    --help; -h:  print this message
    --version; -v: print version
    --debug; -d: show debug messages
    --show; -s:  do not hide window after start
    --icon; -i  <path to png>: use this icon
    --large_icons; -l: allow large icons (> 24x24)
    --borderless; -x: move border, title, frame... from parent
    --menu; -m: "menu text:command": add entry to popdown menu
      (and execute "command"...)
    --title; -t <sec>: show title change for <sec> seconds
                     probably most usefull for xmms


**Requirements:
   
   Compile:
      
    - X Window stuff
    - GTK+ >= 2.4
       
   Run:
   
    - Gnome 2 with "Panel Notification Area" applet.
