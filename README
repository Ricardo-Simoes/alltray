  With AllTray you can dock any application into the
  system tray/notification area. A high-light feature is
  that a click on the "close" button will minimize to system tray.
  It is written in C using GTK and Xlib. It works well with Gnome,
  KDE and XFCE 4.2.

**Install:

  (./autogen.sh)
  ./configure
  make

  and as root:

  make install


**Run:

  just start alltray with:

    alltray program_name
      
  This will dock the program into the system tray. A single click
  with the left mouse button on the icon will show the program.
  A click with the right mouse button will show a popdown menu.
  
  A click on the "close" button in the window title will not exit the
  application. The application will be minimized.
  
  To quit the application use the popdown menu or the "FILE->QUIT" menu
  from the application.


**All options:

  alltray -h:
  
  usage: alltray [options] <program_name> [program parameter]
  
  where options include:
  
    --help; -h:  print this message
    --version; -v: print version
    --debug; -d: show debug messages
    --show; -s:  do not hide window after start
    --hide_window; -hw: hide window during startup (experimental)
    --icon; -i  <path to png>: use this icon


**Requirements:
   
   Compile:
      
    - X Window stuff
    - GTK+ >= 2.4
       
   Run:
   
    - Gnome 2 with "Panel Notification Area" applet.
