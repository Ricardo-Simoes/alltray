AllTray README
==============

  AllTray enables one to dock any application with no native docking
  support into the system tray or notification area.  It is useful
  when used with software such as Evolution, Thunderbird, or any other
  application that one may want to run persistently but not always
  have the window open and/or available.

  AllTray aims to be desktop environment and window manager
  independent software.  It is known to work with GNOME, KDE, XFCE,
  Fluxbox, and WindowMaker.  It aims to work transparently to the
  user, and provide functionality that is useful for all of its users.

Overview
========

  Installation instructions follow the usual process for GNU software.
  For any additional assistance in building and installing the
  software, see the INSTALL document that comes with the source
  distribution of this software.  See also some of the installation
  notes below in the “Installation Notes” section for additional
  information.

  To use AllTray, just start AllTray with:

   $ alltray program_name

  This will dock the program into the system tray. A single click with
  the left mouse button on the icon will show the program.  A click
  with the right mouse button will show a popup (context) menu.

  To dock an already-running application (“click mode”), just run:

   $ alltray

  ... and then click on the window that you would like to dock.

  A click on the "close" button ("X") in the window title will not
  exit the application. The application will be minimized.

  To quit the application, you can terminate it in the usual way; if
  the usual way is to use the window’s close button, you can use the
  context menu on the docked icon to quit the application.

  For details on AllTray usage, please see the AllTray man page (say
  “man alltray” to view the man page after AllTray is installed).

Project Hosting
===============

  AllTray is hosted on the Launchpad project hosting/management
  service run by Canonical[1].  It uses the Bazaar (bzr) revision
  control system (which is part of the GNU project).  Bugs in AllTray
  should be reported on Launchpad[2].

  Because AllTray now has a public revision control system, people can
  work on it and submit patches much more easily than they could
  previously.  If you have the time and ability to fix something,
  please create a local branch of the bzr repository on your system by
  issuing the following command (assuming that bzr is installed):

   $ bzr branch lp:alltray/trunk

  You will then be able to make modifications to the code and commit
  to your local branch.  When your changes are ready to be reviewed,
  you can push those changes back up to Launchpad:

   $ bzr push lp:~YOUR_LP_USERNAME/alltray/MY_BRANCH_NAME

  Replace YOUR_LP_USERNAME with your Launchpad login, and replace
  MY_BRANCH_NAME with a short name which effectively describes your
  branch.  For example if you created a local branch to add the
  ability to view widgets in the software, and your LP username is
  “acme”, you would use something similar to the following:

   $ bzr push lp:~acme/alltray/view-widgets

  After you have done that, you can link the branch to a bug in
  Launchpad, or you can propose that the branch be merged into the
  mainline (trunk) for AllTray development.

  See the Launchpad Help[3] for more information on using Launchpad,
  and if you have any questions, feel free to email the maintainer
  directly[4].

Releases and Announcements
==========================

  Old releases of AllTray are available from the historic releases
  portion of the project on Launchpad[5].  Project news will be
  disseminated using the Launchpad Announcements system, and can be
  tracked in an RSS reader by subscribing to the feed[6].

  New releases of AllTray will be announced on Launchpad, and builds
  of AllTray will be provided for both the current LTS and current
  interim release of Ubuntu shortly after new releases are made.  For
  other distributions, you will need to either build AllTray manually
  or wait for your distribution to package a new release of the
  AllTray software.

Installation Notes
==================

  If you are installing AllTray on a system that does not use GConf,
  you will need to pass --disable-gconf to the configure script.  This
  is temporary; this should be detected as a conditional dependency
  and will be fixed in a future release.

Usage Notes
===========

  Under some window managers/desktop environments, you may need to
  pass the --nm option to AllTray for drag-and-drop functionality to
  work properly.

Bugs
====

  See Launchpad for the list of current bugs.  Also, the fact that
  there is a need for the two previous sections in this file is a bug
  that needs to be fixed in a future release of AllTray.

Dependencies
============

  Build-time dependencies:
    * An implementation of the X11 Window System (tested with X11R7,
      using the X.org implementation).  Development headers are also
      required.
    * GTK+ 2.2 or later.
    * Optionally: GConf 2.x

  Run-time dependencies: 

    * The build-time dependencies (minus the development headers).
    * A window manager, desktop environment, or other software which
      implements the System Tray specification.
