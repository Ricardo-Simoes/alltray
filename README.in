Quick Introduction
==================

  AllTray is used for docking application software---such as Evolution,
  your Web browser or terminal emulation software---into your system tray/
  notification area.  This makes it possible to keep your desktop
  uncluttered when the software you are using needs to continue running,
  but you don't want to continue to see the window(s) in your taskbar or
  window list.

  Do note that at this time, there are issues with KDE 4.x and AllTray
  interacting with each other; windows do not properly become totally
  hidden in this environment, and that means that things act a bit
  strange currently.  Using AllTray with KDE 4.x is not (yet) recommended.
  KDE is aware of the issue and working to find a solution to the problem.

Operating System Support
========================

  Currently, AllTray is only officially supported on GNU/Linux
  systems.  There is some support (possibly, maybe) for FreeBSD, but I
  can't seem to test it because the X server under FreeBSD keeps dying
  on me.  I'd like to also support:

   * NetBSD,
   * OpenBSD, and
   * OpenSolaris

  At the very least.  I don't have access to any proprietary UNIX
  systems with X on them to see if it works (or if I can make it work)
  on them, so volunteers would be greatly appreciated for any other
  systems.

  If you have have the time, and you have a system that AllTray can be
  made to run on (e.g., a POSIX or UNIX-like or UNIX system with the X
  Window System and a compliant window manager and system tray
  implementation, such as GNOME), you can help by looking at the
  unix_process code and creating an implementation for your platform
  and adding some code to configure.ac to support detection of that
  platform, so the proper code is compiled in at build-time for that
  system when configured on that system.

  Before you start work, please file a bug on Launchpad for that
  system and assign it to yourself, so that it's known that you're
  working on that functionality.  When you've completed it, please
  upload a branch back up to bzr and propose that it be merged in with
  AllTray's trunk branch.

  At that point, it will be reviewed and (likely) merged.
