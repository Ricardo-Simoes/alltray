Quick Introduction
==================

  AllTray is used for docking application software---such as Evolution,
  your Web browser or terminal emulation software---into your system tray/
  notification area.  This makes it possible to keep your desktop
  uncluttered when the software you are using needs to continue running,
  but you don't want to continue to see the window(s) in your taskbar or
  window list.

  Do note that at this time, there are issues with KDE 4.x and AllTray
  interacting with each other; windows do not properly become totally
  hidden in this environment, and that means that things act a bit
  strange currently.  Using AllTray with KDE 4.x is not (yet) recommended.
  KDE is aware of the issue and working to find a solution to the problem.
